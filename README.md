# CSI CS FlowChart

## Introduction

A flowchart is a graph that is meant to make it simple for a student to plan their application journey. This web application is a digital extension of that idea; it allows students to explore and interact with their flowcharts in an accessible manner. This project, built for the computer science department and by students in the department, originated from the [initial version](https://flowchart-csi.vercel.app/) created by [Andrea Habib](https://github.com/AndreaHabib) with the help of Kristi Nielson-Brescia. Recognizing some accessibility issues, the department decided to rewrite and enhance the application to better serve the needs of our students and faculty.
